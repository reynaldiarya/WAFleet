## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We take the security of this donation platform seriously and encourage responsible disclosure.

To report a vulnerability, please [open a private security advisory on GitHub](https://github.com/reynaldiarya/WAFleet/security/advisories/new).

If you are looking for existing advisories, they are available [here](https://github.com/reynaldiarya/WAFleet/security/advisories).

For bugs or suggestions **not related to a security issue**, please [open a new issue here](https://github.com/reynaldiarya/WAFleet/issues/new). *(Please search existing issues first.)*

A well-written vulnerability report should ideally include:

- Identification of the affected file(s) or module(s)
- A clear description of how the vulnerability can be reproduced
- The potential impact or consequences
- A proof of concept (if possible)
- Recommendations for a possible fix or mitigation

### Regarding AI Tools

We welcome the use of AI tools in the research and discovery process. However, we **do not accept fully AI-generated reports** due to issues with reliability and quality control.

**Security research requires human understanding and expertise. If you rely solely on AI without proper validation, please refrain from submitting a report.**
